Design barriers. "I don't know what I want the computer to do."

Selection barriers. "I know what I want the computer to do, but I don't know what constructs in this programming language
to use."

Coordination barriers. "I know what I want to use, but I don't know how to combine constructs to create complex
functionality."

Use barriers. "I know what to use, but I don't have a full enough understanding of the syntax and semantics of the
constructs to use them properly."

Understanding barriers. "I thought I knew how to use this, but compiler errors and runtime errors don't make sense to me."

Information barriers. "I think I know why it didn't do what I expected, but I don't know how to get the value of internal
variables."
